              Files for OpenMM-PLUMED-Enabled Tinker Executables
              ##################################################

       This directory contains the files needed to build Tinker versions
       of the ANALYZE, BAR and DYNAMIC programs using the GPU-capable
       OpenMM libraries, in turn linked to the PLUMED library.
       The files in this directory should be copied into the /source
       directory of a clean distribution of Tinker, and the programs can
       be compiled and linked in that modified /source directory.

       Building OpenMM-PLUMED-enabled executables requires a special
       version of OpenMM, called Tinker-OpenMM, and available via a
       separate GitHub branch, currently https://github.com/TinkerTools/
       Tinker-OpenMM. This version has changes from the canonical
       Stanford OpenMM that are needed for the Tinker interface, beyond
       implementation of the AMOEBA force field. Other requirements are
       the PLUMED library from https://github.com/plumed/plumed2, and
       the OpenMM-PLUMED plugin from https://github.com/peastman/
       openmm-plumed.

       The provided Makefile can be used, after minor edits, to build
       GPU-enabled executables. Either the GNU compilers or the Intel
       compilers can be used. The Makefile assumes OpenMM is found in
       its default location, /usr/local/openmm. NVIDIA CUDA V9 or later
       must be installed on the target machine, as well as a CUDA-capable
       graphics card.
